  Go Noisy Project

This project is a Go implementation inspired by the original [Noisy Project](https://github.com/1tayH/noisy). It generates random web traffic using various protocols, HTTP methods, and user-agents to simulate realistic browsing behavior across a list of domains.

   Features

- **Randomized Protocols**: Randomly selects between `http` and `https`.
- **Randomized HTTP Methods**: Supports random selection between `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.
- **Randomized User-Agents**: Uses a set of popular user-agent strings from different browsers and platforms.
- **Configurable Domains**: Loads a list of domains from a YAML configuration file.
- **Concurrent Requests**: Simulates multiple requests concurrently with customizable delays.

   Requirements

- **Go 1.18 or later**
- A YAML file with the list of domains.

   Setup

    1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-noisy-project.git
cd go-noisy-project
2. Prepare the YAML file (domains.yaml):
Ensure the domains.yaml file contains the list of domains to simulate traffic. Here's an example format:

yaml
Copy code
- domain: example.com
- domain: google.com

3. Run the project:
Since the main.go file is now located in the cmd/ directory, youâ€™ll need to run the project using the following commands.

To Build:

bash
Copy code
go build ./cmd
This will generate an executable file, which you can run with:

bash
Copy code
./go_noisy_project
To Run Directly Without Building:

bash
Copy code
go run ./cmd
You can also specify a custom configuration file using the --config flag:

bash
Copy code
go run ./cmd --config=your_domains.yaml
Alternatively, you can set the configuration file path via an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export NOISY_CONFIG_PATH=your_domains.yaml
go run ./cmd
4. Specify Delays:
The program will ask for the minimum and maximum delay between each request (in seconds). Simply provide the values when prompted.

Example Output

bash
Copy code
Request to https://example.com with method POST and User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3 returned status: 200 OK
Request to http://google.com with method GET and User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36 returned status: 200 OK
