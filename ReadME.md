# Noisy Go

**Noisy Go** is a Go implementation inspired by the original [Noisy Project](https://github.com/1tayH/noisy). It generates random web traffic using various protocols, HTTP methods, and user-agents to simulate realistic browsing behavior across a list of domains.

## Features

- üåê Randomized Protocols: Randomly selects between `http` and `https`.
- üì® Randomized HTTP Methods: Supports random selection between `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.
- üë§ Randomized User-Agents: Uses a set of popular user-agent strings from different browsers and platforms.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Domains: Loads a list of domains from a YAML configuration file.
- üöÄ Concurrent Requests: Simulates multiple requests concurrently with customizable delays.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or later
- A YAML file with the list of domains.

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jawws19/Noisy_Go.git
cd Noisy_Go
```

### Prepare the YAML File

Ensure that the `domains.yaml` file contains the list of domains to simulate traffic. Here's an example of the format:

```yaml
- domain: example.com
- domain: google.com
- domain: facebook.com
```

### Run the Project

Since the `main.go` file is located in the `cmd/` directory, you‚Äôll need to run or build the project as follows:

#### To Build the Project

```bash
go build ./cmd
./Noisy_Go
```

#### To Run the Project Directly Without Building

```bash
go run ./cmd
```

You can also specify a custom configuration file using the `--config` flag:

```bash
go run ./cmd --config=your_domains.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can set the configuration file path via an environment variable:

```bash
export NOISY_CONFIG_PATH=your_domains.yaml
go run ./cmd
```

## Usage

When running the project, you will be prompted to enter a minimum delay and maximum delay between site visits (in seconds). This allows you to customize the intervals for the simulated requests.

### Example Commands

```bash
go run ./cmd --config=domains.yaml
```

You'll be asked to enter the time delays:

```bash
Enter minimum delay between site visits (in seconds): 1
Enter maximum delay between site visits (in seconds): 5
```

### Example Output

```bash
