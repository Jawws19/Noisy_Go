Noisy Go

Noisy Go is a Go implementation inspired by the original Noisy Project. It generates random web traffic using various protocols, HTTP methods, and user-agents to simulate realistic browsing behavior across a list of domains.

Features

üåê Randomized Protocols: Randomly selects between http and https.
üì® Randomized HTTP Methods: Supports random selection between GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD.
üë§ Randomized User-Agents: Uses a set of popular user-agent strings from different browsers and platforms.
‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Domains: Loads a list of domains from a YAML configuration file.
üöÄ Concurrent Requests: Simulates multiple requests concurrently with customizable delays.

Setup

Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Jawws19/Noisy_Go.git
cd Noisy_Go
Prepare the YAML File
Ensure that the domains.yaml file contains the list of domains to simulate traffic. Here's an example of the format:

yaml
Copy code
- domain: example.com
- domain: google.com
- domain: facebook.com
You can also include other domains as per your needs.

Run the Project
Since the main.go file is located in the cmd/ directory, you‚Äôll need to run or build the project as follows:

To Build the Project

bash
Copy code
go build ./cmd
./Noisy_Go
To Run the Project Directly Without Building

bash
Copy code
go run ./cmd
You can also specify a custom configuration file using the --config flag:

bash
Copy code
go run ./cmd --config=your_domains.yaml
Alternatively, you can set the configuration file path via an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export NOISY_CONFIG_PATH=your_domains.yaml
go run ./cmd
Usage

When running the project, you will be prompted to enter a minimum delay and maximum delay between site visits (in seconds). This allows you to customize the intervals for the simulated requests.

Example Commands
bash
Copy code
go run ./cmd --config=domains.yaml
You'll be asked to enter the time delays:

bash
Copy code
Enter minimum delay between site visits (in seconds): 1
Enter maximum delay between site visits (in seconds): 5
Example Output
bash
